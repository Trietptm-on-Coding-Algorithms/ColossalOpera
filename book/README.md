# what

the reddit dailyprogrammer challenge book, a pile of my own challenges (and some of my own solutions). mainly done to see if it could be semi-automated.

the vision is a book of challenges that describe key aspects of programming, like topics (algorithms, data structures, strategies, etc) and difficulty levels, well organized and illustrated with code examples. people learning to code, or improving their coding, compose the intended audience. ideally we'd have multiple solutions per challenge showcasing various languages and paradigms, like OOP vs functional programming, logic programming and imperative programming and more. preferably idiomatic, exemplar solutions. 

# how

you'll need

* Pandoc for Markdown to LaTeX conversion - http://pandoc.org/installing.html
* LaTeX itself - https://tug.org/
* the LaTeX minted package - https://github.com/gpoore/minted
* which requires Pygments - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pygments

that seems to be it. 

# when

dunno, sometime .... 

# may i?

at this point this is just my own stuff, my own challenges and code, so i will let you look at this with a creative commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license - you can use it, share it with attribution, but not make money on it.
