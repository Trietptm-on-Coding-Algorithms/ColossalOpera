# what

the reddit dailyprogrammer challenge book, a pile of my own challenges (and some of my own solutions). mainly done to see if it could be semi-automated.

the vision is a book of challenges that describe key aspects of programming, like topics (algorithms, data structures, strategies, etc) and difficulty levels, well organized and illustrated with code examples. people learning to code, or improving their coding, compose the intended audience.

# how

you'll need

* LaTeX
* the LaTeX minted package https://github.com/gpoore/minted
* which requires Pygments https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pygments

that seems to be it. 

# when

dunno, sometime ....
