# Description

A word square is a type of acrostic, a word puzzle. In a word square you are given a grid with letters arranged that spell valid English language words when you read from left to right or from top to bottom. The challenge is that in arranging the words that you spell valid words.

One variant is where you're given an n*n grid and asked to place a set of letters inside to meet these rules. That's today's challenge: given the grid dimensions and a list of letters, can you produce a valid word square.

# Input Description

You'll be given an integer telling you how many rows and columns (it's a square) to use and then n^2 letters to populate the grid with. Example:

    4 eeeeddoonnnsssrv

# Output Description

Your program should emit a valid word square with the letters placed to form valid English language words. Example:

    rose
    oven
    send
    ends
