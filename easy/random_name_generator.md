**Title** Band Name Generator

**Difficulty** Easy

**Description**

One of the neat features of Github is that if you let it, the site will create a semi-random project name for you, like "tiny-octo-opera". These names can be amusing, the kinds of things you'd never brainstorm working by yourself. They make great project names and also band names. 

For this project, you'll be writing one of these project name generators. You can use your own wordlists, or feel free to use the wordlists gathered here: https://github.com/paralax/BrassGlue/tree/master/wordlists . They're broken out by part of speech or topic (e.g. metals). I find that these names are a lot better when you use parts of speech or things like metals and dogs. 

**Input Description**

Your program should take a single argument *N* on the command line, an integer, telling you how many names to generate. Example:

    ./generate 7

**Output Description**

Your program should emit a set of random combinations of words of length *N*. Example:

    gigantic garlic
    copper beagle
    flaming axe
    tin manx
    scowling snow
    aluminum gerbil
    carbon viper
